Activity: Create a fibonacci sequence calculator which creates a list containing the 
first n terms in the fibonacci sequence. n is determined by user input.
Fibonacci sequence:
    1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...
    U(1)=1, U(2)=1, U(n+1)=U(n)+U(n-1)
    The first two numbers in the fibanacci sequence are both 1
    The next number in the fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers
Example: User enters the number 10:
    Calculate and print out the first 10 numbers in the sequence: [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
Example: User enters the number 200:
    Calculate and print the first 200 terms in the sequence: [1,1,2,3,5,...,280571172992510140037611932413038677189525]
