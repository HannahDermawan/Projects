Activity: Write a script which asks for the user’s full name and gender. If user is male, print “Hello Mr {name}”.
If gender is female, ask for marital status of user. If user is female and married, 
print “Hello Mrs {name}”. If user is female and unmarried, print “Hello Ms {name}”. 
Make sure the script asks again for the gender or marital status if an unsuitable answer is provided 
(e.g: the question is “Please enter your gender [M/F]”, and the answer was “123”, print(“invalid response”) before asking again)
